Geolocalization using Wifi Access Points

CONTEXT
1)When you walk in the street, your device (smartphone if wifi is on)
detects many different wifi Access Points. Your smartphone is also
equipped with a GPS,
2)The idea of the project would be to create an Android application able,
after a learning phase, to infer the position from Access Points records.

PROJECT
1)Record in a database, couples made of (GPS position, {names of
Access Points detected at that point }),
2)Put on the map a layer representing the density of APs,
3)After some time, allow users to localize themselves without the need of
using GPS,
4)In order to improve the process of information gathering, two friends can
exchange their information through the network.
